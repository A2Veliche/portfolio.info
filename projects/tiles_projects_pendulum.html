							<h2 class="major">Automatic Cat Feeder</h2>
							<p>While on vacation for a few days, I needed a way to keep our cat fed on a daily basis. I decided to quickly fabricate a cat feeder out of mateirals I found in my garage. The idea was to use a rotating disk and an equally-compartmentalized cylinder. Each compartment holds a cat's daily ration of food, and every 24 hours, the disk rotates into position under that compartment to let the food fall through by its own weight. This contraption would be mounted above the cat bowl.</p>

							</span>
							<p> After an initial round of brainstorming, I modeled the idea in SolidWorks, making sure to size the components according to the stepper motors and pieces I already had on hand. The rotating disk would be secured by the screw-on lid of the plastic container, and all sliding surfaces would be lubricated to prevent them from seizing up.</p>

							</span>
							<p> For the axle which connects the large gear to the disk I used a wooden dowel on which I press fit everything else (and sanded it where it needed to rotate freely). I also 3D printed the two gears which increased the torque from the motor.</p>

							<p> The final step was to put the prototype to the test. The house was cold during our departure, so although the stepper motor heated up to around 120 degrees Fahrenehit due to several days of powered use, it didn't burn out in the end.

						<!-- Machining -->
						<article id="machining">
							<h2 class="major">Machining</h2>
							<p>I have been working as a Junior Machinist at the Forsyth machine shop on Northeastern's campus since the spring of 2021. Here are a few projects during which I have employed most of my machining knowledge and learned more.</p>

							<h3>Aesthetic Spinning Top</h3>
							<p> The idea was to make a top which would make a satisfying desk toy but also demonstrate the possibility of joining multiple material types into a solid object. As the hardness of the point of contact leads to decreased fricitonal losses, I chose to use a brass exterior with a stainless steel core.</p>

							<h3>Benchtop 2-in-1 Toolpost </h3>
							<p>When inserting a cutting tool in a 5C collet (used on the Tormach mills), the collet needs to be secured in place while a torque wrench is used to tighten it properly. The challenge was to design a toolholder to hold 2 different collet sizes as to economize for space on the worktable.</p>

								<p style="text-align:center"> Designing the toolholder by sketching. A requirement is to accomodate 2 different collet sizes.</p>
							</span>
							<p>The 1/4 in steel pieces were first waterjet, then press fit, and then welded together. The main challenge was getting the tolerances right at the surfaces of contact, but this was solved after two iterations.</p>

							<p>In the end, this in-house solution performed better and more reliably than Tormach's collet closers.</p>
