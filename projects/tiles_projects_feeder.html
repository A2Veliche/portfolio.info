						<h2 class="major">Automatic Cat Feeder</h2>
						<p>While on vacation for a few days, I needed a way to keep our cat fed on a daily basis. I decided to quickly fabricate a cat feeder out of mateirals I found in my garage. The idea was to use a rotating disk and an equally-compartmentalized cylinder. Each compartment holds a cat's daily ration of food, and every 24 hours, the disk rotates into position under that compartment to let the food fall through by its own weight. This contraption would be mounted above the cat bowl.</p>

						<p> After an initial round of brainstorming, I modeled the idea in SolidWorks, making sure to size the components according to the stepper motors and pieces I already had on hand. The rotating disk would be secured by the screw-on lid of the plastic container, and all sliding surfaces would be lubricated to prevent them from seizing up.</p>

						<p> For the axle which connects the large gear to the disk I used a wooden dowel on which I press fit everything else (and sanded it where it needed to rotate freely). I also 3D printed the two gears which increased the torque from the motor.</p>

						<p> The final step was to put the prototype to the test. The house was cold during our departure, so although the stepper motor heated up to around 120 degrees Fahrenehit due to several days of powered use, it didn't burn out in the end.
